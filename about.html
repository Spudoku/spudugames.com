            <h1>About</h1>
            <h2><u>What is Spudugames?</u></h2>
            <p>This is a place where I get to talk about things and show off my game development "expertise". Basically
                it's my own playground on the internet
                where I do whatever, whenever.</p>
            <h2><u>Who are <i>you</i>?</u></h2>
            <p>I go by several aliases, but you can call me Spuduking (Spoo-doo-king). I like to garden, read, hike,
                play games and make games. I'm currently studying
                Computer Science.</p>

            <h2><u>The Blogs</u></h2>
            <p>I might attempt to stick to some kind of schedule when adding blog entries.</p>
            <h3>Game Discussions</h3>
            <p>These will be the bread-and-butter of the blog section of this website. They
                include reviews of specific games ("formal" and "informal"), interesting game mechanics and anything
                else that I find
                interesting about games, their development and their execution.
            </p>
            <h3>Author Updates</h3>
            <p>
                These blog entries will be more personal, such as cool things I've learned, what I've been doing IRL, or
                why x-y-z project is being
                delayed.
            </p>
            <h3>Brain Leaks</h3>
            <p>
                Whatever I want to post that doesn't fit into the above categories. This might include hot takes,
                "shower thoughts",
                art, poetry, creative writing, and so on. Don't expect everything to be SFW, or "polite". In other
                words, Brain Leaks are not appropriate for children, nor for adults who don't act like children.
            </p>


            <h2><u>How Can I Reach You?</u></h2>
            <p>I might put up an email address or something.</p>
