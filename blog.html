                    <p>Cobalt is a masterpiece and, I'd wager, a seriously strong representative for the 2-D platformer
                        shooter. This and future posts should demonstrate this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Achilles' Heel to Cobalt's success (besides marketing) has to be how <i>fiendishly hard</i>
                        the game is to pick up. As a younger gamer,
                        I avoided the game while I watched my brother fumble around with the controls. The tutorial,
                        even the advanced tutorial, doesn't encapsulate the whole depth
                        of the mechanics. Seriously, it takes hundreds of hours to get anywhere near 'good'.
                    </p>
                    <p>Even as a single player game (I've never been able to get an online match in any gamemode),
                        Cobalt has plenty of options. A relatively satisfying campaign, combat and speed challenges, and
                        several other
                        gamemodes. Survival mode, being my favorite, will get its own lengthy post.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the unusual control scheme may drive one away, I will hopefully demonstrate why Cobalt is
                        an underappreciated masterpiece.

                <div class="blog-content invisible">
                    <p>A friend recently invited me to the Deadlock Playtest a few weeks ago. I've been obsessed ever
                        since.</p>
                    <p>This isn't exactly a review so I won't bother educating you about the game too much. So, in
                        short, Deadlock is a
                        third-person Shooter/MOBA where you slaughter robot-like things, weird abominations and of
                        course other players by the hundreds in order to summon a god.
                    </p>

                    <p>This game tickles a lot of what I like doing in games, such as strategizing, optimization and
                        shooting people in the face.
                        Therefore I gravitate towards characters (heroes) that do those things well. Examples
                        (currently)
                        include Drifter, Vindicta, Abrams and Ivy. Keep in mind that my list isn't comprehensive to what
                        I like simply because
                        I only have 40 or so hours in the game (yes, 'only' 40 hours) and I'm kind of dogshit at the
                        game still.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I found it really confusing at first how less obvious mechanics such as Spirit Power work, but a
                        little understanding
                        has gone a long way. Playing the tutorial is not enough to get a firm understanding on
                        everything. Outside research is highly recommended.
                        I guess that goes to show that Deadlock is designed to be one of those games that are highly
                        competitive (it's a MOBA after all).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Many of the heroes are already pretty goddamn iconic, from the sophisticated evil of Seven,
                        Viscous' Cube, REM's childlike whimsy... it's incredible. Valve is of course adept at creating
                        characters
                        like the TF2 mercs (some of my favorite characters in fiction), various Half Life characters and
                        even the silent protagonists of
                        Portal and Half Life. So its no surprise that Valve cooked with Deadlock.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What I'm concerned about for Deadlock's future is character bloat. There are currently about 38
                        playable heroes (I don't remember if that includes the newest additions like Silver, Celeste and
                        Apollo).
                        That's already a lot for me to handle (skill issue I know). However, I don't want Deadlock to
                        turn into another Brawl Stars.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I used to play Brawl Stars a lot during my teenage years. During the first years following its
                        released, I genuinely loved
                        the game. But over time, as new brawlers and features were added, the game got cumbersome and
                        less fun for someone like me who likes to know everything. It got clunky too, with gadgets and
                        second star powers
                        and other random garbage clogging the screen. (Actually, gadgets weren't too bad on their own).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I don't want Deadlock to have so many heroes that it becomes difficult to remember all of their
                        names and kits.
                        Since the heroes are original characters, it doesn't work like a game like Super Smash Bros
                        Ulitmate does. And, depending on how Deadlock will be monetized, feature bloat may become
                        essential.
                        Best case, it will simply be cosmetic items like outfits, hats (TF2!!!), taunts and so on. Worst
                        case,
                        pay-to-win like Brawl Stars. Thankfully, Valve has a track record of the former so I hope my
                        concerns will be unwarranted.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Deadlock is actually fun, like most Valve titles. I look forward to putting hundreds of hours
                        into it, and I may
                        report further to you here.
