            <p>Announcer: INTRUDER ALERT! A RED SPY IS IN THE BASE!</p>
            <p>Soldier: A red spy is in the base?</p>
            <p>Announcer: Protect the briefcase!</p>
            <p>Soldier: We need to protect the briefcase!</p>
            <p>Scout: Yo, a lil' help here?</p>
            <p>Soldier: I got it, stand back son. 1, 1, 1, ummm, 1.</p>
            <p>Scout: Let's go, let's go!</p>
            <p>Heavy: INCOMING!</p>
            <p>Scout: AAA-hey, it's still here!</p>
            <p>Spy: Ahem. Gentlemen.</p>
            <p>[Meet the spy intro plays.]</p>
            <p>Spy: I see the briefcase is safe. </p>
            <p>Scout: yeah it is.</p>
            <p>Soldier: safe and sound.</p>
            <p>Tell me, did you happen to kill a red spy on the way here? No? Then we
                still have a
                problem.</p>
            <p>Soldier: And a knife.</p>
            <p>Scout: Oooh, big problem. I've killed plenty of spies, they're dime-a-dozen back-stabbing scumbags - like
                you! Ow. No
                offense.</p>
            <p>Spy: If you managed to kill them I assure you they were not like me. And nothing, nothing like the man
                loose inside
                this building.</p>
            <p>Scout: What are you, president of his fan club?</p>
            <p>Spy: No, that would be your mother!</p>
            <p>Scout: [Stammers]</p>
            <p>Spy: Indeed, and now he's here to f**k us! So listen up boy, or pornography starring your mother will be
                the second
                worst thing that happens to you today.</p>
            <p>Soldier: Oh!</p>
            <p>Scout: Gimmie that!</p>
            <p>Spy: The spy has already breached our defenses.</p>
            <p>Engineer: Sentry down!</p>
            <p>Spy: We've seen what he's done to our colleagues!</p>
            <p>Sniper: [Gets backstabbed] Ahhhh!</p>
            <p>Spy: And worst of all, he could be any one of us!</p>
            <p>Medic: Raus, raus!</p>
            <p>Red Spy: [Turns into Medic]</p>
            <p>Medic: Nein...</p>
            <p>Spy: He could be you, he could be me, he could even be-</p>
            <p>Scout: Whoa, whoa, whoa!</p>
            <p>Soldier: What? It was obvious! He's the red spy! Watch, he should be turning red any second now......any
                second. See,
                red! Oh, wait that's blood.</p>
            <p>Heavy: So, we still have problem.</p>
            <p>Soldier: Big problem. All right, who's ready to go find this Spy?</p>
            <p>Scout (now Red Spy): Right behind you.</p>
